# Pokemontrainerapp

This project was created by Aino Yl√§-Outinen and Max Bowen for the Noroff Front End course.

The project was conducted as pair work and took roughly 40 hours to create

https://pokemon-trainer-blue.vercel.app/login

## Functionality

The task was to build a pokemon trainer application that uses PokeAPI data to display pokemon and allow the user to catch pokemon and view them in their trainer page 

The application uses guard services to protect the endpoints and redirects the user back to the login page if they try to access other components of the application before logging in.

The application uses the Noroff API to handle user details.

The application was built using the Angular framework, Javascript, TypeScript, html, css, Railway.

## Running the application

To run the application you must first 

`npm install` the project

`ng serve` to launch the project
